Create Installer

Remove old non-free meter code

Create support for plug-in meter code

Notes
=====

Replace critical sections with RAII code from DScaler

Getting memory leaks on exit after some operations switch to smart pointers 

Getting exceptions thrown in normal operation, try and change

Move common Delta E target stuff into a function

Review english dialog labels for double negatives

Review threading code and protection of arrays

Remove themeing?


Thoughts
========

Switch to just strings localization to speed up resource updating
something like http://beta.codeproject.com/KB/locale/translator.aspx?msg=1153839
should work much better, that way the translation can lag development.

Convert project to UNICODE

Replace ini file with registry to allow for saving unicode strings?
