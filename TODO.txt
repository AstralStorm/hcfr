Thoughts
========

something like http://beta.codeproject.com/KB/locale/translator.aspx?msg=1153839
should work much better, that way the translation can lag development.

Convert project to UNICODE

Replace ini file with registry to allow for saving unicode strings?

something along the lines of http://www.curtpalme.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10457
