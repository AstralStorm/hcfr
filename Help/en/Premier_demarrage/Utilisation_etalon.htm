<h2><span class=TitreTropic>Using calibration files</span></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="hcp2">Preliminary</h2>

<p class="hcp3"><span class=Heading3Short>What is a calibration 
 file ? This is a file containing a color coordinates conversion matrix. 
 HCFR probe measures colors in its own RGB colorspace. Each projector emit 
 light with a particular spectrum. Since </span>there is an infinite number 
 of possible light spectra to obtain a D65 calibrated white, it's somewhat 
 difficult for some tri-stimulus colorimeters to see what is absolute D65. 
 Tri-stimulus commercial probes try to have a native RGB colorspace which 
 match as much as possible XYZ normalized colorspace. This condition allow 
 measuring D65 without any conversion matrix (or, at least, using always 
 the same conversion matrix), for any projector.</p>

<p class="hcp3">HCFR probe is not in capable of that. Its 
 own colorspace is relatively different from XYZ colorspace. It needs a 
 conversion matrix for each projector model to guarantee what the probe 
 considers D65 is really D65. Without calibration file, or with incorrect 
 calibration file, any color could be considered as white.</p>

<p class="hcp3">So, why did we base HCFR probe on colorimetric 
 sensor needing calibration file, while it would have been easier for everybody 
 to get rid of that ? Answer is simple: TAOS sensors have other qualities: 
 they are more sensible and offer better repeatability than most tri-stimulus 
 sensors. And they allow building a relatively cheap probe, with relatively 
 easy work.</p>

<p class="hcp3">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="hcp2">Choosing the right calibration file</h2>

<p class="hcp4"><span class=Heading3Short>When creating a 
 new measure document, you must choose the right calibration file. If a 
 calibration file exists for your projector, just select it, and that's 
 all. If not, you can build it by yourself, using calibration file building 
 features in advanced menu, but you need a reference colorimeter for that 
 operation, and it is not always easy to find.</span></p>

<p class="hcp4"><span class=Heading3Short>If you don't have 
 the right calibration file, and no way to make your own, you can often 
 use calibration file for another projector, if you choose a model from 
 the same brand, which is technically similar. After calibrating using 
 this calibration file, you can easily see if targeted white looks really 
 white. In this case, the calibration file is suitable. If not, meaning 
 calibrated white looks greenish, bluish or any color except white, the 
 calibration file does not match you projector.</span></p>

<p class="hcp4">If no suitable calibration file can be found, 
 you must build one by yourself. Of course, it will not guarantee calibrated 
 white will respect precisely D65 standard, but it will make possible to 
 guarantee all gray levels are the same color, so dark grays are not bluish 
 and light gray redish, and also ensure your brightness, contrast and gamma 
 settings are OK. In fact, even if white is not exactly D65, having a balanced 
 colorimetry on all gray scale, and a regular gamma curve is the most important 
 part of calibration, at the condition that white is near D65 enough.</p>

<p class="hcp4"><span class=Heading3Short>To build an approximate 
 calibration file, play with your projector settings displaying at a white 
 pattern. Using your eyes, change settings to make the white pattern appear 
 really white. Not bluish, not greenish, not redish. As much perfectly 
 white as possible. But take care of one thing: D65 is not the same white 
 than the one displayed by a computer monitor, which is often slightly 
 bluish, to make is more &quot;vibrant&quot;. At the opposite, D65 is a 
 white slightly &quot;hot&quot;, and it can give impression to be very 
 subtly yellow, meaning absolutely not bluish. To get this estimated D65 
 white, you will generally use color temperature setting on &quot;low&quot;, 
 &quot;6500K&quot;, &quot;D65&quot;, with colorimetric settings near zero. 
 Eventually, adjust this white using primary color gain settings, to obtain 
 a white which looks &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;pure&quot; at the same time.</span></p>

<p class="hcp4"><span class=Heading3Short>When this is done, 
 use the basic calibration file building feature in the advanced menu. 
 This calibration file will target the white you determined using your 
 eyes during above step, and will consider projector primary colors match 
 exactly the color standard selected for calibration file building. It 
 will be impossible to judge gamut, nor check if target white is D65 or 
 not, but you can balance RGB levels and optimize gamma curve, which is 
 essential for a balanced and realistic image.</span></p>
